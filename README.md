**RareSeek-R1** is a domain-specialized large language model tailored for rare-disease diagnostic reasoning, developed through a Progressive Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning framework. 

The model is first instruction-tuned on the clinically grounded **RareMed-Corpus**, a large, multi-source dataset deeply integrated from medical textbooks, guidelines, biomedical literature, and real-world EHR (Electronic Health Record) narratives. It is subsequently fine-tuned on **RareMed-CoT**, a high-fidelity corpus designed to instill explicit, stepwise clinical reasoning that aligns with real-world diagnostic workflows.

## 🛠 Usage Pipeline

Our framework supports a comprehensive end-to-end pipeline, from EHR preprocessing to diagnostic evaluation.

### 1. EHR Preprocessing
To standardize multi-lingual real-world clinical notes, we translate non-English (e.g., Chinese) EHRs into English. English EHRs will be automatically bypassed during this step.
```bash
python rare_disease_ehr_translator.py
```

### 2. Phenotype Extraction (Baselines & LLMs)
For comparative analysis of phenotype-based approaches and to evaluate the discrepancy between EHR narrative texts and phenotype diagnostics, we employ several extraction algorithms.

#### A. Traditional Baselines
We benchmarked against [PhenoTagger](https://github.com/ncbi-nlp/PhenoTagger) and [PhenoBERT](https://github.com/EclipseCN/PhenoBERT). Please configure the parameters as follows:

| Algorithm | Parameter | Value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **PhenoTagger** | `model_type` | `pubmedbert` |
| | `onlyLongest` | `True` |
| | `abbrRecog` | `True` |
| | `negation` | `True` |
| | `ML_Threshold` | `0.95` |
| **PhenoBERT** | `param1` | `0.8` |
| | `param2` | `0.6` |
| | `param3` | `0.9` |
| | `use_longest` | `True` |
| | `use_step_3` | `True` |

#### B. LLM-based Phenotype (HPO) Extraction
We utilize LLMs for high-fidelity Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) extraction. 
1. **Model Preparation**: Download [BioLORD-2023-M](https://huggingface.co/FremyCompany/BioLORD-2023-M) for phenotypic terminology embeddings and place it in the `BioLORD/` folder.
2. **LLM Backend**: You can either deploy [DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B) locally or use API calls (e.g., [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/) / [DeepSeek APIs](https://platform.deepseek.com/)).
3. **Start the Extraction Service**:
   ```bash
   uvicorn llm_hpo_extraction_service:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```
4. **Run the Extraction Client** (Example using DeepSeek-R1 API):
   ```bash
   python llm_hpo_api_client.py
   ```

### 3. Model Inference
We utilize `vLLM` to accelerate inference. You can deploy the model in a batch setting or run it interactively.

**Batch Inference (via Slurm):**
```bash
cd inference
sbatch inference.sh
```

**Python Demo Inference:**
```python
import json
from vllm import LLM, SamplingParams

def load_data(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        return [json.loads(line.strip()) for line in file]

def build_prompt(context):
    return f"{context} What is the rare disease that the patient is most likely to be diagnosed with?"

# 1. Load sample data
data = load_data("sample_data/sample.jsonl")

# 2. Configure sampling parameters
sampling_params = SamplingParams(temperature=0.8, top_p=0.95)

# 3. Initialize vLLM (Replace with local path "models/RareSeek-R1" if downloaded)
llm = LLM(model="TaoMedAI/RareSeek-R1") 

# 4. Generate predictions
for entry in data:
    prompt = build_prompt(entry["context"])
    outputs = llm.generate([prompt], sampling_params)
    
    for output in outputs:
        print(f"Prompt: {prompt}\nGenerated Text: {output.outputs[0].text}\n{'-'*50}")
```

### 4. Post-processing & Normalization
After generating the narrative diagnostic reasoning, we extract and standardize the disease entities.

1. **Entity Extraction**: Extract specific disease names from the LLM outputs.
   ```bash
   python rare_disease_entity_extractor.py
   ```
2. **Standardization**: Normalize the extracted disease entities into standard vocabularies (Orphanet and OMIM codes) via the Monarch Initiative API.
   ```bash
   python monarch_api_client.py
   ```

### 5. Evaluation
We provide comprehensive evaluation scripts to measure the diagnostic accuracy using both **Exact Evaluation** and **Hierarchical Evaluation**.

- **Reference Format**: See the standardized output format at `./sample_data/EHR-Internal_Phenotype.jsonl`.
- **Run Evaluation**: Execute `evaluation.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
  > *Note:* The Hierarchical Evaluation relies on the Orphanet hierarchical structure file: `Classifications of rare diseases.json`. Ensure this file is present in your working directory.
